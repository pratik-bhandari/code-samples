## About code samples

This repository contains a sample of codes I wrote during my PhD to create a data preprocessing and analysis pipeline. Most of these codes were used in the preparation of manuscripts; some were stored in my university Gitlab repo, not included in any manuscripts.

There are no data files in this repository. If you are interested in running these codes with the accompanying data, then you can go to my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/wc49z/) or refer to my papers published in [Frontiers in Psychology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.714485) and [Language and Cognition](https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2022.16).

These codes are only for demonstration purposes.
